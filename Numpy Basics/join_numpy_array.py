Joining NumPy Arrays
Joining means putting contents of two or more arrays in a single array.

In SQL we join tables based on a key, whereas in NumPy we join arrays by axes.

We pass a sequence of arrays that we want to join to the concatenate() function, along with the axis. If axis is not explicitly passed, it is taken as 0.

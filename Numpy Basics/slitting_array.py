"""
Splitting NumPy Arrays
Splitting is reverse operation of Joining.

Joining merges multiple arrays into one and Splitting breaks one array into multiple.

We use array_split() for splitting arrays, we pass it the array we want to split and the number of splits.

Splitting 2-D Arrays
Use the same syntax when splitting 2-D arrays.

Use the array_split() method, pass in the array you want to split and the number of splits you want to do.
